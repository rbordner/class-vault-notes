LO 12-1 Key Characteristics of a Debt Investment & Demonstrate how to account for a purchase and for interest reve nue.

```

 ```ad-note
title:  Debt Investment
collapse: open
> 
> Companies invest in debt too. Like a CD, a bond or other debt security has a specified date when it matures, and on that maturity date, the principal (also called the face amount or maturity value) is paid to investors. In the meantime, interest equal to some stated interest rate multiplied by the principal is paid to investors on specified interest dates (usually twice a year).
>  Think of the principal and interest payments of the bond as a stream of cash flows that an investor will receive in the future in exchange for purchasing the bond today. The investor values that stream of future cash flows based on the prevailing market interest rate for debt of similar risk and maturity at the time the investor purchases the bond.

“Common Financing Instruments”  
Which of the following are common financial instruments used to finance or expand a company’s operations? (Select all that apply.)

- [ ] Common stock  
- [ ] Property, plant and equipment  
- [ ] Corporate bonds  
- [ ] Accounts receivable

<summary>Reveal Correct Answers & Explanations</summary>

- **Common stock** (Correct)  
  - Equity instrument representing ownership; companies sell shares to raise capital.

- **Corporate bonds** (Correct)  
  - Debt instrument; investors lend money and the company repays with interest.

- **Preferred stock** (Correct)  
  - Hybrid equity/debt instrument; pays fixed dividends and has priority over common stock.

- Property, plant and equipment (Incorrect)  
  - These are long-lived assets purchased with financing, not instruments used *to* raise funds.

- Accounts receivable (Incorrect)  
  - Represents amounts owed by customers, not a financing instrument.

> >[Notice that United paid $666,633 to purchase the $700,000 bonds. Why the difference? To determine the issue price of the bonds, it’s important to understand how investors compare the bond’s stated rate with the market rate. If the interest rate paid by the bond (the stated rate) is higher than the market rate, investors are willing to purchase the bond for more than its maturity value (so it’s sold at a premium). If the bond’s stated rate is lower than the market rate, then investors are willing to purchase the bond only at an amount less than its maturity value (so it’s sold at a discount). Masterwear was offering its bonds for 12%, but investors could have obtained bonds of similar risk and maturity at a more favorable, higher rate of 14%. To attract investors, Masterwear had to sell its bonds at a discount.

title: Question 
collapse: open
question “Bond Pricing Formula”
Which expression correctly gives the price of a bond?  

- [ ] Present value of future interest payments only  
- [ ] Present value of principal only  
- [ ] PV of coupons × PV of principal  
- [ ] Present value of future interest payments **+** present value of principal  

<details>
<summary>Reveal Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer:**  
Present value of future interest payments **+** present value of principal  

**Why:**  
(in everyday terms):

    Each coupon is worth a little less today.

        Imagine you’ll get $50 in one year. Because of the waiting, that $50 might be “worth” only about $45 today (if the market rate is 10%).

        You do that for every coupon—so instead of fancy symbols, just divide each future payment by (1 + r)^t to see what it’s worth now.

    The lump-sum at maturity is also “shrunk” back to today.

        You know you’ll get $1,000 at the end. But waiting makes that $1,000 “worth” maybe only $620 today (if you discount it for 6 periods at 10%).

        Again: divide the face value by (1 + r)^n.

    Add those two results—and that’s your bond price.

        “What are all the little coupons worth today?”

            “What is that big final payment worth today?”

        = Total price you’d pay right now.

Number example:

    $50 coupon each year for 3 years, market rate 10%

        Year 1 coupon ≈ $50⁄1.10 = $45.45

        Year 2 coupon ≈ $50⁄1.10² = $41.32

        Year 3 coupon ≈ $50⁄1.10³ = $37.56

    $1,000 face at Year 3 ≈ $1,000⁄1.10³ = $751.31

    Price ≈ 45.45 + 41.32 + 37.56 + 751.31 = $875.64

For discounted bonds, interest revenue is ______ cash interest each interest period.

- [ ] greater than  
- [ ] equal to  
- [ ] smaller than  

<details>
<summary>Simple Explanation</summary>

**Think of buying a “sale-price” snack card:**  
- You pay \$90 for a card that still gives you \$10 of snacks each period.  
- **Cash in hand**: you clip the coupon and get \$10.  
- **True value earned**: because you only paid \$90, that \$10 is really worth more than \$10 on your \$90 investment—it’s like earning \$11.11 in “snack value.”  

So your **interest revenue** (the real earning) is **greater than** the **cash coupon** you actually receive.

| Cash (price paid for the bonds)...................................................................... | 666,633 |
[^1]:Because United purchased the bonds for an amount that’s less than their face amount, it credits Discount on bond investment for the difference. Discount on bond investment is a contra-asset to the investment account that serves to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its cost at the date of purchase. If United instead had purchased the bonds for an amount (say, $725,000) that is higher than the face amount of the bond ($700,000), it would instead debit Premium on bond investment (for $25,000) to record the investment at its cost at the date of purchase.

title: Calculating Interest Received 
collapse: open
Interest **received** is calculated based on the `Stated or Face` interest rate.

### The Candy Machine Analogy

Imagine you have a special candy machine. It’s your machine, and on the front it’s labeled:

> **“Insert 1 gold coin → Get 3 candies”**

- **Your machine’s rule (“3 candies per coin”)** is like the **stated** (face) rate.
    
- **What candy costs in the store** (maybe 2 candies per coin or 4 candies per coin) is like the **market** rate—but it doesn’t change _your_ machine.
    

So when you go to get candies from _your_ machine, you always use **3 candies per coin**, because that’s the promise printed on it—no matter what the store does.

**Key point:**

> **Interest received = the “3 candies” number on _your_ machine = the stated rate.**

---

- If you insert 2 gold coins, you get 2 × 3 = 6 candies.
    
- You _never_ calculate using what the store is doing—you always use _your_ machine’s printed promise.
    

That’s why, when a bond pays you cash interest, you always use the **stated** (face) rate printed on the bond, not the market rate.

```ad-info
title: Three Classifications of Debit Investments
collapse: closed

The amortization schedule shown in Illustration 12–2 is based on the market interest rate (14%) that prevailed at the time United purchased the Masterwear bonds. United will use that amortization schedule for the life of the investment, and won’t change it in response to changes in prevailing interest rates. However, the prevailing market rate may not always be 14%. Because market participants will use the prevailing market interest rate to compute the present value of the cash flows provided by the bonds, `the fair value of the bonds will change as interest rates change`. United will incur unrealized holding gains and losses as a result of holding the bonds during periods in which its fair value changes.

If the market rate of interest rises after a bond is purchased, the market will compute the present value of the cash flows provided by the bond using that higher discount rate, so the fair value of the bond falls. In that case, the person holding the bond suffers an unrealized holding loss. The fair value of the bond has decreased, but that loss hasn’t been realized, because the investment has not been sold.

Conversely, if the market rate of interest falls after a bond is purchased, the market will calculate the present value of the cash flows provided by the bond using that lower rate, so the fair value of the bond rises. In that case, the investor holding the bond enjoys an unrealized holding gain. The fair value of the bond has increased but that gain hasn’t yet been realized, because the investment hasn’t been sold.

title: Debt Investments to Be Held-to-Maturity (HTM)
collapse: open
Unrealized Holding Gains and Losses Are Not Recognized for HTM Investments


Unrealized holding gains and losses are less important if sale before maturity isn’t an alternative, because those gains and losses will never be realized by sale. For this reason, if an investor has the “positive intent and ability” to hold the securities to maturity, investments in debt securities typically are classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) and reported at their amortized cost in the balance sheet.2 A debt security cannot be classified as held-to-maturity if the investor might sell it before maturity in response to changes in market prices or interest rates, to meet the investor’s liquidity needs, or similar factors.

title: Impairment of HTM Investments
collapse: closed
Impairment of HTM Investments

There is one important exception to the general rule that companies don’t recognize unrealized gains and losses for HTM investments. You learned in Chapter 7 that companies are required to use the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model to account for bad debts with respect to accounts receivable and notes receivable. Companies likewise are required to use the CECL model to account for credit losses on HTM investments. That requires companies to make an estimate of the amount of interest and principal payments they won’t receive in the future. Companies account for that estimate by recognizing a credit loss in net income and reducing the carrying value of the HTM investment with an allowance for credit losses, just like they recognize bad debt expense and an allowance for uncollectible accounts for accounts receivable. In Appendix 12B we provide an illustration of recognizing credit losses for HTM investments.

  - Realized gains and losses are shown in net income in the period in which securities are sold. Unrealized holding gains and losses are disclosed in the notes to financial statements. Investments in HTM securities do not affect other comprehensive income.

- Balance Sheet: 
  - Investments in HTM securities are reported at amortized cost, less any allowance for credit losses. Fair values of those investments are disclosed in the notes to financial statements.

- Cash Flow Statement: 
  - Cash flows from buying and selling HTM securities typically are classified as investing activities.

title: Debt Investments Classified as Trading Securities
collapse: open
Debt Investments Classified as Trading Securities

	Some companies—primarily financial institutions—actively and frequently buy and sell securities, expecting to earn profits on short-term price fluctuations. Investments in debt acquired principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities. The holding period for trading securities generally is measured in hours and days rather than months or years. These investments typically are reported among the investor’s current assets. Usually only banks and other financial operations invest in securities in the manner and for the purpose necessary to be categorized as trading securities.
	
	Just like HTM investments, trading securities are recorded at cost when they are purchased, and any discount or premium is amortized to interest revenue over time as periodic interest payments are received. However, in subsequent periods, there are two important differences between trading securities and HTM investments.
	
- 1. Trading securities are written up or down to their fair value, or “marked to market,” inthe balance sheet. (HTM securities are kept at amortized cost.)
- 2. Corresponding unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included innet income in the income statement. (HTM securities do not include unrealized holdingsgains and losses in net income.)

Be sure to notice that reporting trading securities at their fair value is a departure from amortized cost, which is the way many assets are reported in the balance sheet. Why the difference? **For trading securities,** **<span id="fv-relevance">fair value information is more relevant than for other assets intended primarily to be used in company operations</span>**, like buildings, land and equipment, or for debt investments intended to be held-to-maturity. Changes in fair values provide an indication of management’s success in deciding when to acquire the investment, when to sell it, whether to invest in fixed-rate or variable-rate securities, and whether to invest in long-term or short-term securities. For that reason, it makes sense to report unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities in net income during a period that fair values change, even though those gains and losses haven’t yet been realized through the sale of the securities.

Which of the following fundamental concepts or principles supports the use of the fair value method?

_(See the “fair value is more relevant” sentence in the summary above:  
[Jump to relevance sentence](#fv-relevance))_  

- [ ] Conservatism  
- [x] Relevance  
- [ ] Reliability  
- [ ] Consistency  



<details>
<summary>Reveal Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer:** Relevance  


**Relevance** underpins fair-value measurement because it ensures that financial statements reflect the current economic value of assets and liabilities, giving users the most timely and useful information for decision-making.

- **Fair value** updates an asset’s carrying amount to what it could fetch today in an arm’s-length transaction, rather than historical cost that may be outdated.
    
- This **forward-looking** measurement provides investors and creditors with information that is more predictive of future cash flows.
    

By contrast:

- **Reliability** (verifiability) often favors historical cost.
    
- **Conservatism** might understate assets rather than adjust them to fair market prices.
    
- **Consistency** governs applying the same methods period-to-period but doesn’t by itself require fair-value measurements.
    

Thus, the **relevance** principle justifies marking investments and other financial instruments to fair value when those measurements better inform users about an entity’s current financial position and performance.

title: Adjust Trading Security Investments to Fair Value (2024)
collapse: open
Unlike HTM securities, trading securities are carried at fair value in the balance sheet, so their carrying value must be adjusted to fair value by the end of every reporting period. In fact, many companies adjust trading securities to fair value at the end of every day. Rather than increasing or decreasing the investment account itself, we use a valuation allowance, fair value adjustment, to increase or decrease the carrying value of the investment. At the same time, we record an unrealized holding gain or loss that is included in net income in the period in which fair value changes (remember, the gain or loss is unrealized because the securities haven’t been sold).

Assuming the Masterwear bonds have a fair value of $714,943 as of December 31, 2024, the next table shows the calculation of the balance in the fair value adjustment account that is required on that date.


`Trading securities are adjusted to their fair value in each reporting period.`

![[Pasted image 20250515135636.png]]

The bonds need to be reported at their fair value of $714,943. Because the bonds currently are recorded at their amortized cost of $671,297, the fair value adjustment account needs a debit balance of `$43,646`. United will recognize whatever unrealized holding gain or loss is necessary to move the fair value adjustment from its current balance of $0 (at purchase date) to $43,646 (on December 31, 2024). In this case, the calculation is simple:

The journal entry to record the $43,646 change in United’s fair value adjustment and the corresponding unrealized holding gain is:

![[Pasted image 20250515135902.png]]

*Sometimes companies don’t bother with a separate fair value adjustment account and simply adjust the investment account to fair value.

†We indicate “unrealized, NI” to highlight that, for trading securities, unrealized holding gains and losses are included in the income statement in the period in which they occur.

Each period United owns the Masterwear bonds, it will recognize whatever unrealized holding gain or loss is necessary to move the fair value adjustment to the value it needs to have at the end of the accounting period. Increases in the fair value adjustment produce gains on trading securities that increase net income; decreases produce losses that decrease

net income.

Sale of Trading Security Investments

Now assume that United sells the bonds for $725,000 on January 5, 2025. To account for the sale, United needs to do two things. First, United needs to update the carrying value of the bonds to fair value and record in net income any unrealized holding gains and losses that occurred during 2025 up to the date of sale. Second, on the date of sale, United needs to record the receipt of cash and remove the amounts associated with the investment from the relevant balance sheet accounts. Let’s record each of these entries. (As in our example for HTM investments, for simplicity we ignore interest earned during the first five days of 2025.)

1. Adjust Trading Securities to Fair Value (2025). We first need to update the fair value adjustment and recognize any unrealized holding gains or losses that have occurred during the current reporting period prior to the date of sale. We already have accounted for fair value changes that occurred during 2024. Now we need to record the additional fair value changes and their related unrealized holding gains and losses that have occurred each day in 2025 up to the moment of sale. Companies might record these changes in fair value at the end of each day, but we use a single summary entry that captures those changes in fair value up to the moment of sale.

Remember that on December 31, 2024, the amortized cost of the Masterwear bonds was $671,297, and the fair value was $714,943. We recorded a fair value adjustment of $43,646 for this unrealized holding gain. Now, on January 5, 2025, the fair value has increased further to $725,000, so we need to update the fair value adjustment for the additional $10,057

increase in fair value.


`For trading securities, unrealized holding gains and losses from fair value changes are recorded up to the date an investment is sold.`

![[Pasted image 20250515140543.png]]

2. Record the Sale Transaction. After making the previous journal entry, the investment

is carried at its fair value as of the date it is being sold, and already has included in net

income any gain or loss arising from the difference between amortized cost and fair value

as of the date of sale. All that remains is for United to record receipt of cash and remove the

investment-related accounts from the balance sheet (again, for simplicity we ignore interest

earned during the first five days of 2025).

When a trading security is sold, all of the gain or loss already has been included in net income, so no additional gain or loss is recognized.

![[Pasted image 20250515140637.png]]

As with the sale of the HTM investment, we record the receipt of $725,000 cash and remove all the balance sheet accounts associated with the investment. However, unlike the HTM investment, our TS investment has an additional balance sheet account, the fair value adjustment, that needs to be removed when we record the sale. Another difference between the HTM and TS approach is that, because we carry trading securities at fair value as of the date of sale and already have included in net income the entire gain associated with changes in the fair value of the investment, there is no gain or loss to recognize on the date of sale.6 However, over the life of the investments, United recognized the same amount of gain under the TS approach ($43,646 + 10,057 = $53,703) as it recognized upon sale under the HTM approach ($53,703). The only difference is timing, with trading securities recognizing unrealized holding gains and losses from fair value changes as they occur but the HTM approach recognizing gains or losses only when they are realized upon sale.

```ad-summary
title: Financial Statement Presentation
collapse: open
Trading securities appear in the financial statements as follows:

	∙ Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income: For trading securities,gains and losses are included in the income statement in the periods in which fair value changes, regardless of whether they are realized or unrealized. Investments in trading securities do not affect other comprehensive income.

	∙ Balance Sheet: Investments in trading securities are reported at fair value, typically ascurrent assets.

	∙ Cash Flow Statement: Cash flows from buying and selling trading securities typicallyare classified as operating activities, because the financial institutions that routinely holdtrading securities consider them as part of their normal operations.
