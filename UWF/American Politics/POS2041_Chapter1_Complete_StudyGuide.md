## üóÇÔ∏è Introduction
- **Political Polarization**
    - High political polarization reflecting strong modern partisanship.
- **Concerns of the Framers**
    - Worried about **majority tyranny**.
    - Concerned about voters‚Äô lack of interest in real solutions.
- **Politics as Collective Action**
    - Politics involves bargaining and compromise to resolve conflicts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Importance of Institutional Design
- **Need for structured negotiation** due to competing preferences.
- **Definition:**
	- Creation of rules and structures that shape political decisions.
- **Importance:** 
	- Resolves conflicts, reduces uncertainty, and enables agreements by enforcing compromises.
- **Example:**
	- Bicameral legislature (two chambers, each can veto the other) stabilizes long-term agreements.
- **Challenges:**
    - Unstructured negotiation can lead to mistrust.
    - Fear of broken promises makes agreements difficult.
- **Solutions:**
    - Establish institutions with prior agreements.
    - Institutional designs make agreements permanent.

## üèõÔ∏è Constitutions and Governments
- **What is a Constitution?**
    - Set of rules governing decision-making.
    - U.S.: Formal, written constitution.
    - Britain: Informal, unwritten constitution.
- **Government as an Institution**
    - Collective institutions enforcing agreements.
    - Defines authority (right to make decisions) and power (control over others).
- **Authority vs. Power**
    - **Authority:** Official right to make decisions.
    - **Power:** Actual influence exerted beyond formal authority.
- **Institutional Durability**
    - Stability of institutions that outlast individuals.
- **Logic of the Political System**
    - Institutional values shape political logic.

## üîç Collective Action Problems
- **Definition:** Difficulties when a group tries to reach a common goal.
- **Overview:**
    - Complex, requiring cooperation and coordination.
### üìå Two Fundamental Problems:
1. **Coordination Problems**
    - Difficulty increases with larger populations.
    - Solutions simplified by focal points or smaller decision-making groups.
2. **Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma**
    - Better to cooperate, but strong incentives to defect.
    - Classic example: "Law and Order" interrogation scenario.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Collective Action Issues
- **Free Rider Problem**
    - Individuals benefit without contributing (group projects, labor unions).
- **Tragedy of the Commons**
    - Overuse of shared resources (overfishing, environmental degradation).
    - Solutions: regulation or privatization.

---

## üí∞ Costs of Collective Action
- **Participation is costly.**
### Types of Costs:
- **Transaction Costs**
    - Resources required to reach agreements. Higher transaction costs = harder decisions.
- **Conformity Costs**
    - Sacrifices when collective decisions contradict personal preferences.
- **Trade-off:**
    - High transaction costs mean low conformity costs and vice versa.
    - U.S. system designed with high transaction costs (gridlock) to minimize conformity costs (tyranny).

---

## üì¢ Representative Government
- Combines representation with majority rule.
- Delegates collective decisions to elected officials, blending democracy with republican structures.
- **Direct Democracy (Athenian-Style):** Rare today, involves citizens voting directly (referendums,  ballot initiatives).
- **Republic:** A type of representative democracy balancing popular control and stability, avoiding direct democracy‚Äôs chaos.
- **Transaction Costs in Constitution:**
    - Constitution imposes high transaction costs to protect minorities.
- **Parliamentary vs. Presidential System**
    - **Parliamentary:** Executive-legislature linked (Britain).
    - **Presidential:** Separation of powers (U.S.).

## üöß The Work of Government
- **Public Goods**
    - Everyone benefits; use by one doesn't limit another's enjoyment (clean air, national defense).
- **Private Goods**
    - Exclusive, individual benefits (privatized toll roads).
- **Collective (Mixed) Goods**
    - Combine public provision with some private incentives. (Federal incentives, conversions)

## üß≠ Conclusion
- Effective collective action emphasized by framers.
- Constitution balances efficiency and fairness.
