## 1. Key Concepts & Flowchart
- **Types of Investments**
  - **Debt**: HTM ▸ Trading ▸ AFS
  - **Equity**: FV-NI ▸ Equity Method ▸ Consolidation
- **Measurement Models**
  - **HTM**: Amortized cost; ignore FV changes
  - **Trading**: FV, P/L → IS
  - **AFS**: FV, unrealized → OCI; realized → P/L
  - **Equity (<20%)**: FV, P/L
  - **Equity (20–50%)**: Record proportionate net income; dividends ↓ INV
- **Impairment**
  - HTM/AFS credit losses → CECL (allowance)
  - AFS other FV ↓ → OCI or P/L based on intent to sell

## 2. Measurement Summary Table
| Category           | Initial Valuation   | Subsequent Measurement          | Unrealized Gains/Losses | Income Statement  | OCI |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | --- |
| Held-to-Maturity   | Cost + Amortization | Amortized Cost                  | Ignored                 | Interest only     | –   |
| Trading            | Cost + Fees         | Fair Value                      | Yes                     | Yes               | –   |
| Available-for-Sale | Cost + Fees         | Fair Value                      | Yes                     | No                | Yes |
| Equity (<20%)      | Cost + Fees         | Fair Value                      | Yes                     | Yes               | –   |
| Equity (20–50%)    | Cost + Fees         | Equity in Net Income; FV for UL | N/A                     | Yes (share of NI) | –   |

## 3. Quick-Study Guide
1. **Classification**: determine intent & influence  
2. **Journal Entries**:  
   - **Purchase**: Dr Investment; Cr Cash  
   - **Interest Revenue (Debt)**: Dr Cash; Cr Interest Revenue (effective rate)  
   - **Unrealized (Trading)**: Dr Investment; Cr Unrealized Gain  
   - **Unrealized (AFS)**: Dr/Cr OCI; Cr/Dr Investment  
   - **Equity Method**:  
     - Dr Investment; Cr Equity in Net Income (% NI)  
     - Dr Cash; Cr Investment (dividends)  
3. **Impairment**:  
   - **HTM/AFS**: CECL → Allowance for Credit Losses  
   - **AFS**: credit loss → P/L; non-credit → OCI  
4. **Presentation**: AFS at FV, present amortized cost + allowance; HTM at amortized cost; Trading at FV; Equity as single line.

## 4. Memory Tricks
- **“HAT AF”**: HTM, AFS, Trading  
- **“VAPE E”**: Value→P/L for Passive (FV-NI), Equity Method for Significant Influence  
- **OCI‐AFS/NI‐Trading**: AFS → OCI, Trading → NI

## Classification
- **Debt**:  
  - HTM (hold to maturity)  
  - Trading (near-term sale)  
  - AFS (available-for-sale)  
- **Equity**:  
  - <20%: FV→P/L  
  - 20–50%: Equity Method  
## Measurement
| Cat. | Initial | Subseq.          | Unrealized | Recognized In |
|------|---------|------------------|------------|---------------|
| HTM  | Cost    | Amortized Cost   | –          | Interest only |
| TR   | Cost    | FV→P/L           | P/L        | P/L           |
| AFS  | Cost    | FV→OCI           | OCI        | Realized P/L  |
| EQ<20| Cost    | FV→P/L           | P/L        | P/L           |
| EQ≥20| Cost    | Equity→NI & CB   | N/A        | NI            |

## 6. Learning Objectives (“Crayon-Eater”)
- **LO12-1**: Pick debt or equity, then classify HTM/TR/AFS or <20%/20-50%/>50%.  
- **LO12-2**: HTM = cost + amortization  
- **LO12-3**: Trading = fair value → P/L immediately  
- **LO12-4**: AFS = fair value → OCI, P/L on sale  
- **LO12-5**: <20% equity = FV → P/L  
- **LO12-6**: 20-50% equity = share net income, adjust investment    
- **LO12-7**: If FV of net assets > book at acquisition, adjust goodwill at start  
- **LO12-8**: Fair value option = use FV→P/L for any chosen investment  
- **LO12-9**: IFRS more restrictive on fair value option, different impairment model  

## 7. Mastery Tips
- Draw decision trees daily  
- Flashcards for each category  
- Timed journal drills (5 entries in 3 minutes)  
- Connect to ratios: ROE, ROA, Debt/Equity
