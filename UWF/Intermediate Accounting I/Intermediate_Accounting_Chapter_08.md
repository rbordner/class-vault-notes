# Chapter 8: Inventories – Measurement

---

## Overview

Inventory is a current asset representing goods held for **sale in the ordinary course of business** or **used in the production of goods for sale**.  
This chapter focuses on how inventory is **measured**, **costed**, and **reported**, and the impact of different methods on the income statement and balance sheet.

## 🏷️ Types of Inventory

| Company Type   | Inventory Components                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Merchandising  | Merchandise Inventory                      |
| Manufacturing  | Raw Materials, Work in Process, Finished Goods |

## 🧮 Inventory Equation

The basic **cost of goods sold** formula:

$$
\text{COGS} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Net Purchases} - \text{Ending Inventory}
$$

---

## 🧾 Inventory Systems

### 1. **Perpetual System**
- Continuous tracking
- Inventory and COGS updated with each sale/purchase

### 2. **Periodic System**
- Inventory and COGS updated **at period end**
- Uses purchases account during the period

---

## 🧾 Journal Entry Comparison

**Purchase of inventory – $5,000:**

- **Perpetual:**
```
Dr. Inventory ............... 5,000  
   Cr. Accounts Payable ........ 5,000
```

- **Periodic:**
```
Dr. Purchases ............... 5,000  
   Cr. Accounts Payable ........ 5,000
```

## 📦 Cost Flow Assumptions

Used to assign cost to inventory and COGS when units are identical.

### 1. **Specific Identification**
- Used for unique, high-value items
- Matches physical flow to cost flow

### 2. **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**
- Oldest inventory costs → COGS
- Ending inventory = most recent costs

### 3. **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**
- Newest costs → COGS
- Ending inventory = oldest costs
- Not allowed under IFRS

### 4. **Weighted Average**
- Smooths out price fluctuations

#### Formula:
$$
\text{WA Cost per Unit} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Available for Sale}}{\text{Units Available for Sale}}
$$

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Method | COGS (Inflation) | Ending Inventory | Net Income |
|--------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| FIFO   | Lower            | Higher           | Higher     |
| LIFO   | Higher           | Lower            | Lower      |
| WA     | Moderate         | Moderate         | Moderate   |

## 🚛 Freight, Returns, and Discounts

### Freight-In
- **Added to inventory cost** (perpetual)
- Added to **net purchases** (periodic)

### Purchase Returns
- **Perpetual**: reduce Inventory  
- **Periodic**: recorded in Purchase Returns account

### Purchase Discounts
- **Gross Method**: discounts recognized at payment  
- **Net Method**: assume discount taken upfront

---

## 📅 Inventory Cutoff and Consignment

### Inventory Cutoff
- Goods shipped **FOB shipping point** → buyer includes when shipped  
- Goods shipped **FOB destination** → buyer includes when received

### Consignment
- **Consignor** retains ownership
- **Consignee** holds inventory but does not record it

---

## 📘 Example – Periodic FIFO

| Date       | Purchase      | Units | Unit Cost | Total Cost |
|------------|---------------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Jan 1      | Beginning Inv | 100   | $10       | $1,000     |
| Jan 10     | Purchase      | 200   | $12       | $2,400     |
| Jan 20     | Purchase      | 100   | $14       | $1,400     |
| **Total**  |               | 400   |           | $4,800     |

**Sale: 250 units**

- FIFO COGS = 100×10 + 150×12 = $3,400  
- Ending Inventory = 50×12 + 100×14 = $2,000

---

## 🔁 LIFO Reserve

When companies use **LIFO** for tax and external reporting, they must disclose a **LIFO Reserve**.

$$
\text{LIFO Reserve} = \text{Inventory (FIFO)} - \text{Inventory (LIFO)}
$$

### Adjusting Journal Entry:
```
Dr. COGS ........................... XX  
   Cr. LIFO Reserve .................... XX
```

## 🧾 Summary Journal Entries – Periodic System

| Action                | Debit                  | Credit               |
|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Purchase              | Purchases              | Accounts Payable     |
| Return to Supplier    | Accounts Payable       | Purchase Returns     |
| Period-end Adjustment | Inventory, COGS        | Purchases, Inventory |

---

## Summary

- Inventory is measured based on cost and affected by the cost flow assumption chosen
- **FIFO**, **LIFO**, and **Weighted Average** impact COGS, ending inventory, and net income differently
- Perpetual and periodic systems affect when and how inventory transactions are recorded
- Disclosures like **LIFO Reserve** are essential for comparability

> **Tip for Mastery:** Know how inventory flow methods impact **income tax**, **working capital**, and **ratios** like current ratio and gross margin.
