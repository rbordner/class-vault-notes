# Chapter 7: Cash and Receivables

---

## Overview

This chapter covers **cash**, **accounts receivable**, and **notes receivable**, focusing on **valuation**, **presentation**, and **measurement**.  
Accurate accounting for receivables is critical to matching revenues and recognizing potential credit risks.

---

## 💰 Cash and Cash Equivalents

### Cash includes:
- Coins, currency
- Bank balances
- Checks received but not deposited
- Money orders

### Cash Equivalents:
- Short-term, highly liquid investments
- Maturity < 3 months (e.g., T-bills, commercial paper)

---

## 🔒 Restricted Cash

- Set aside for specific purpose (e.g., debt repayment)
- Disclosed separately if material
- **Classified as current or noncurrent** depending on use date

---

## 🏦 Bank Reconciliation

Reconciles **bank balance** and **book balance** to the correct cash amount.

### Adjustments to Bank:
- + Deposits in transit
- - Outstanding checks

### Adjustments to Book:
- + Collections by bank
- - NSF checks
- - Bank service charges

---

## 📩 Accounts Receivable

Amounts due from customers for sales of goods/services on **credit**.

### Trade vs. Nontrade Receivables:
- **Trade**: From customers (e.g., A/R)
- **Nontrade**: From others (e.g., employee advances, interest receivable)

---

## ✍️ Initial Valuation

Accounts receivable are recorded at **invoice amount**, but ultimately reported at:

### Net Realizable Value (NRV):
$$
\text{NRV} = \text{Gross A/R} - \text{Allowance for Uncollectibles}
$$

---

## 💸 Sales Discounts

### 1. **Gross Method** (record full amount, discount recognized at payment)
### 2. **Net Method** (assume discount taken, adjust if missed)

**Terms example:** 2/10, n/30  
→ 2% discount if paid in 10 days; net due in 30

---

## 🔁 Sales Returns and Allowances

Estimated returns reduce revenue and establish a **refund liability**.

### Journal Entry:
```
Dr. Sales Returns .................. XX  
   Cr. Refund Liability ................ XX  
Dr. Inventory – Estimated Returns .. XX  
   Cr. COGS .............................. XX
```

---

## 🔻 Uncollectible Accounts

### 1. **Direct Write-off Method** (not GAAP)
- Recognize loss when account is deemed uncollectible

### 2. **Allowance Method** (GAAP)
- Estimate uncollectibles and match expense with revenue

### Entry to record estimate:
```
Dr. Bad Debt Expense ............... XX  
   Cr. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ... XX
```

### Write-off actual account:
```
Dr. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ... XX  
   Cr. Accounts Receivable .................. XX
```

### Recovery:
```
Dr. Accounts Receivable ............ XX  
   Cr. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ... XX  
Dr. Cash ............................. XX  
   Cr. Accounts Receivable ............... XX
```

## 📊 Estimation Techniques

### 1. **Percentage of Sales Method**
- Income statement focus  
- Emphasizes matching

### 2. **Aging of Accounts Receivable**
- Balance sheet focus  
- Estimate allowance by age bracket

| Age of Receivable | Balance | % Uncollectible | Estimate |
|-------------------|---------|------------------|----------|
| 0–30 days         | 10,000  | 1%               | $100     |
| 31–60 days        | 5,000   | 3%               | $150     |
| 61–90 days        | 2,000   | 10%              | $200     |
| >90 days          | 1,000   | 25%              | $250     |
| **Total**         |         |                  | **$700** |

## 📝 Notes Receivable

Formal written promises to receive cash (can include interest).

### Interest-bearing Note:
$$
I = P \times r \times t
$$

### Non-interest-bearing Note:
- Recorded at **present value**
- Difference between face and PV is **discount** (contra-asset)

---

## ⏳ Long-Term Notes

Use present value of cash flows discounted at market rate.

If **noncash consideration** received (e.g., equipment), use the **fair value of the asset or note**, whichever is more clearly determinable.

---

## 🔄 Discounting Notes

Companies can **sell notes** before maturity:

- **With recourse**: Seller retains risk
- **Without recourse**: Buyer assumes risk

**Journal Entry – Sale without recourse:**
```
Dr. Cash .................................. XX  
Dr. Loss on Sale of Note .................. XX  
   Cr. Notes Receivable ...................... XX
```

---

## 🔁 Factoring Receivables

Company sells receivables to a **factor** for cash.

- **Without recourse**: Factor assumes risk
- **With recourse**: Seller liable for uncollectibles

## Summary

- Receivables are measured at **net realizable value**, accounting for expected uncollectibles
- Discounts and returns must be properly recognized
- **Allowance method** ensures matching and better accuracy
- **Notes receivable** are reported at present value, with interest accrual
- Factoring and discounting must be analyzed for risk transfer and proper derecognition

> **Tip for Mastery:** Always track how receivable adjustments affect both income and balance sheet presentation.
