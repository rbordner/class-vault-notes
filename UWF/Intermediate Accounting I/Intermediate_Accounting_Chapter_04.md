# Chapter 4: The Income Statement, Comprehensive Income, and Statement of Cash Flows

---

## Overview

This chapter explores the structure and presentation of the **income statement**, the components of **comprehensive income**, and the **statement of cash flows**. Together, these statements reflect a company's **performance**, **profitability**, and **cash-generating ability** over a period.

---

## The Income Statement

### Purpose:
To report a company's **revenues**, **expenses**, **gains**, and **losses** during a specific period of time.

### Key Equation:
$$
\text{Net Income} = \text{Revenues} - \text{Expenses} + \text{Gains} - \text{Losses}
$$

---

## Income Statement Formats

### 1. **Single-Step Income Statement**
- Groups all revenues and gains together
- Groups all expenses and losses together
- Emphasis on net income

### 2. **Multi-Step Income Statement**
- Separates **operating** from **non-operating** activities
- Highlights key subtotals:
  - Gross profit
  - Operating income
  - Income before taxes

**Example:**
```
Sales Revenue ..................... $500,000  
Cost of Goods Sold ............... (300,000)  
Gross Profit ...................... 200,000  

Operating Expenses:  
  Selling Expenses ................ (50,000)  
  Administrative Expenses ........ (30,000)  
Operating Income .................. 120,000  

Other Income (Expenses):  
  Interest Revenue ................ 5,000  
  Interest Expense ............... (10,000)  
Income Before Tax ................ 115,000  
Income Tax Expense ............... (23,000)  
Net Income ....................... $92,000  
```

## Earnings Quality

Refers to the **predictability** and **sustainability** of earnings.  
Analysts distinguish between:
- **Permanent earnings**: recurring
- **Transitory earnings**: nonrecurring or one-time gains/losses

---

## Reporting Irregular Items

### 1. **Discontinued Operations**
- Reported **below income from continuing operations**
- Must involve a major line of business

### 2. **Unusual or Infrequent Gains and Losses**
- Included in continuing operations but disclosed separately

---

## Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Mandatory for publicly traded companies.

### Basic EPS Formula:
$$
\text{Basic EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Weighted Avg. Common Shares Outstanding}}
$$

---

## Comprehensive Income

Includes **net income** and other comprehensive income (OCI):

$$
\text{Comprehensive Income} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Other Comprehensive Income}
$$

### Components of OCI:
- Unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities
- Foreign currency translation adjustments
- Pension adjustments
- Certain cash flow hedges

### Reporting Formats:
1. **Single continuous statement** of comprehensive income
2. **Two separate but consecutive statements** (net income + OCI)

---

## Statement of Cash Flows

Explains changes in **cash and cash equivalents** over a period.  
Three major sections:

### 1. **Operating Activities**
- Cash flows from core business operations

### 2. **Investing Activities**
- Cash flows from acquisition/sale of long-term assets

### 3. **Financing Activities**
- Cash flows from debt, stock issuance, dividends

---

## Cash Flow Methods

### 1. **Direct Method**
Reports **specific cash inflows and outflows**

**Example:**
```
Cash received from customers ..... $480,000  
Cash paid to suppliers ........... (260,000)  
Cash paid for operating expenses . (120,000)  
Net cash from operating .......... $100,000  
```

### 2. **Indirect Method** (most common)
Starts with net income and **adjusts for noncash items**

**Format:**
```
Net Income ....................... $92,000  
Adjustments:  
  + Depreciation Expense ......... 10,000  
  + Loss on Sale of Equipment .... 3,000  
  - Increase in Accounts Receivable (5,000)  
  + Increase in Accounts Payable .. 4,000  
Net Cash from Operating .......... $104,000  
```

---

## Noncash Investing and Financing Activities

These are **disclosed** in a separate schedule or footnote.  
Examples:
- Converting bonds to stock
- Acquiring assets via lease
- Exchanging assets without cash

---

## Summary

- The income statement shows profitability and earnings quality
- Comprehensive income includes items that bypass the income statement
- The statement of cash flows explains cash inflows/outflows across operations, investing, and financing

> **Tip for Mastery:** Always reconcile changes in income and cash flow — profitability ≠ liquidity.
