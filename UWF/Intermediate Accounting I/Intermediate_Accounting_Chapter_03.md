# Chapter 3: The Balance Sheet and Financial Disclosures

---

## Overview

This chapter explains the structure, purpose, and content of the **balance sheet** and discusses various **disclosure requirements**. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a point in time and is a key tool for assessing **liquidity**, **solvency**, and **financial flexibility**.

---

## Purpose of the Balance Sheet

The balance sheet presents a company's:
- **Assets**: Resources owned
- **Liabilities**: Obligations owed
- **Shareholders’ Equity**: Residual interest of owners

### Uses:
- Evaluate capital structure
- Assess risk and return
- Analyze liquidity and solvency

---

## Limitations

- Many assets and liabilities are measured at **historical cost**, not fair value
- Use of **estimates** may reduce precision
- Omits non-monetary assets (e.g., brand reputation)

---

## Balance Sheet Format

Presented in **classified format**, separating **current** and **noncurrent** assets and liabilities.

### Equation:
$$
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Shareholders' Equity}
$$

---

### 4. **Contingencies**

---

### 5. **Fair Value Disclosures**

## Common Financial Ratios

\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

### 3. **Debt to Equity Ratio**
