# Chapter 2: Review of the Accounting Process

---

## Overview

This chapter reviews the accounting information system, emphasizing the **double-entry system**, **debits and credits**, and the complete **accounting cycle**. You will learn how transactions are recorded, adjusted, and closed, and how financial statements are prepared.

---

## The Accounting Equation

The foundation of accounting:

$$
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Owners' Equity}
$$

Any transaction affects at least two accounts to keep the equation in balance.

---

## The Double-Entry System

Each transaction must be recorded in at least two accounts:

- **Debit (Dr)**: Left side of an account
- **Credit (Cr)**: Right side of an account

General rules:
- **Assets** increase with debits, decrease with credits
- **Liabilities and equity** increase with credits, decrease with debits

---

## Types of Accounts

| Account Type | Normal Balance | Increase | Decrease |
|--------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| Assets       | Debit          | Debit    | Credit   |
| Liabilities  | Credit         | Credit   | Debit    |
| Equity       | Credit         | Credit   | Debit    |
| Revenues     | Credit         | Credit   | Debit    |
| Expenses     | Debit          | Debit    | Credit   |
| Dividends    | Debit          | Debit    | Credit   |

---

## Recording Transactions

Transactions are initially recorded in the **general journal**, then posted to the **general ledger**.

**Example:**
```
Jan 2
  Debit: Cash ......................... $10,000  
  Credit: Common Stock ............... $10,000  
```

---

## T-Accounts

Simplified representation of ledger accounts:

```
          Cash
-------------------------
Debit          | Credit
---------------|--------
10,000         | 
               | 2,000
```

## Trial Balances

1. **Unadjusted Trial Balance** – Before adjusting entries  
2. **Adjusted Trial Balance** – After all adjustments  
3. **Post-Closing Trial Balance** – After closing entries

Purpose: Ensure **total debits = total credits**

---

## Adjusting Entries

Made at the end of the period to ensure revenues and expenses are recognized in the period they occur.

### Categories:
1. **Prepayments**
   - Prepaid expenses
   - Deferred revenues
2. **Accruals**
   - Accrued expenses
   - Accrued revenues
3. **Estimates**
   - Depreciation
   - Bad debt expense

### Example – Depreciation:
```
Dec 31
  Debit: Depreciation Expense ......... $500  
  Credit: Accumulated Depreciation .... $500  
```

---

## Closing Entries

Used to reset **temporary accounts** (revenues, expenses, dividends) to zero before the new period.

### Closing Process:
1. Close revenues to **Income Summary**
2. Close expenses to **Income Summary**
3. Close **Income Summary** to **Retained Earnings**
4. Close dividends to **Retained Earnings**

### Example:
```
Dec 31
  Debit: Service Revenue .............. $5,000  
  Credit: Income Summary .............. $5,000  
```

```
Dec 31
  Debit: Income Summary ............... $4,000  
  Credit: Expenses .................... $4,000  
```

```
Dec 31
  Debit: Income Summary ............... $1,000  
  Credit: Retained Earnings ........... $1,000  
```

```
Dec 31
  Debit: Retained Earnings ............ $500  
  Credit: Dividends ................... $500  
```

## The Full Accounting Cycle

1. **Identify and analyze transactions**
2. **Journalize transactions**
3. **Post to ledger accounts**
4. **Prepare unadjusted trial balance**
5. **Record adjusting entries**
6. **Prepare adjusted trial balance**
7. **Prepare financial statements**
8. **Record closing entries**
9. **Prepare post-closing trial balance**

## Summary

- The accounting process is a structured cycle designed to ensure accurate reporting.
- Every transaction follows the double-entry principle.
- Adjusting and closing entries are essential for matching revenues and expenses properly.
- Trial balances are checkpoints to ensure the ledger stays balanced.

> **Tip:** Understanding the flow of transactions through the accounting system is critical to mastering all future financial accounting topics.
