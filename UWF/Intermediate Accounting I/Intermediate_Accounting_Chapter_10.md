# Chapter 10: Property, Plant, and Equipment and Intangible Assets – Acquisition and Disposition

---

## Overview

This chapter focuses on the **initial recognition and measurement** of **property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)** and **intangible assets**, as well as their **disposition**.  
Key topics include **capitalization rules**, **noncash acquisitions**, **asset retirement obligations**, and **gains/losses on disposal or exchange**.

---

## 🏗️ Initial Measurement of PP&E

PP&E is recorded at **historical cost**, which includes:

$$
\text{Capitalized Cost} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{All Costs Necessary to Get Asset Ready for Use}
$$

### Examples of Capitalized Costs:
| Asset     | Included Costs                                         |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Land      | Purchase price, title fees, clearing, razing old bldg |
| Building  | Purchase price, architect fees, permits, renovation   |
| Equipment | Purchase price, shipping, installation, testing       |

## 🔨 Self-Constructed Assets

Firms may construct assets internally.

### Capitalized Costs:
- Direct materials and labor
- Overhead (either full-cost or incremental)
- **Interest cost incurred during construction**

### Interest Capitalization:
Only capitalize **avoidable interest** on average accumulated expenditures (AAE).

$$
\text{Interest Capitalized} = \text{AAE} \times \text{Interest Rate}
$$

- Use specific borrowing rate first  
- Then weighted-average rate on excess AAE

---

## 🔒 Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO)

Legal obligation to dismantle or restore long-lived assets (e.g., oil rigs, mines).

### Initial Entry:
```
Dr. Asset (e.g., Oil Rig) .............. XX  
   Cr. ARO Liability ....................... XX
```

ARO liability = Present value of future removal cost

---

## 🛒 Noncash Acquisitions

Assets acquired:
- **By issuing equity or debt**
- **In exchange for other assets**
- **As donations or grants**

Measured at:
- **Fair value of asset given up**, or
- **Fair value of asset received**, whichever is more clearly evident

---

## 💰 Lump-Sum Purchases

When multiple assets are purchased together, allocate based on **relative fair values**:

$$
\text{Allocated Cost} = \text{Total Price} \times \frac{\text{FV of Asset}}{\sum \text{FV of All Assets}}
$$

---

## 🧠 Intangible Assets

### Purchased Intangibles:
- Record at cost (purchase price + legal/filing fees)

### Internally Developed Intangibles:
- **Research** costs → expensed
- **Development** costs → expensed (GAAP); capitalized (IFRS, if criteria met)

---

## 🔁 Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets

### With Commercial Substance:
- Recognize gain/loss immediately:
$$
\text{Gain or Loss} = \text{Fair Value of Asset Given} - \text{Book Value}
$$

### Without Commercial Substance:
- Gain is deferred unless **boot** is received
- If boot received, recognize **partial gain**

---

## 🧾 Journal Entry – Exchange with Gain

**Example:**
- Old equipment (book value = $5,000, fair value = $7,000)  
- New equipment received (FV = $9,000)  
- $2,000 cash paid

```
Dr. Equipment (new) .................. 9,000  
Dr. Accum. Depreciation .............. XX  
   Cr. Equipment (old) .................... 5,000  
   Cr. Cash .................................... 2,000  
   Cr. Gain on Exchange ................ 2,000
```

---

## 🗑️ Dispositions

### Sale of Asset:
```
Dr. Cash ..................................... XX  
Dr. Accum. Depreciation .......... XX  
   Cr. Asset ....................................... XX  
   Cr. Gain on Disposal ................... XX
```

### Retirement:
```
Dr. Accum. Depreciation .......... XX  
Dr. Loss on Disposal ................... XX  
   Cr. Asset ....................................... XX
```

---

## 📄 Donated Assets

Record at fair value:
```
Dr. Asset ................................... FV  
   Cr. Revenue – Donation ........... FV
```

---

## Summary

- All costs necessary to get an asset ready for use are capitalized
- Self-constructed assets require interest capitalization on AAE
- Asset retirement obligations are present-valued and added to asset cost
- Exchanges with commercial substance trigger gain/loss recognition
- Intangible assets follow strict expensing/capitalization rules

> **Tip for Mastery:** Practice identifying whether a transaction requires immediate gain recognition or deferral based on **commercial substance and boot**.
