## 🧠 Let’s start here: **What are we even doing?**

You’re looking at interest rates—specifically, how different factors affect **bond yields** (how much money a bond pays you).

Imagine this like loaning someone crayons. The more risky, longer, or annoying the loan is, the more crayons you demand back.

There are 4 things that make the bond "pay" more:

|Component|What it means|
|---|---|
|**r***|Real risk-free rate – the "pure" interest without inflation. Think of it as “thank you for letting me borrow the crayon.”|
|**IP**|Inflation premium – because prices rise over time, you want to be repaid with more crayons to make up for it.|
|**DRP**|Default risk premium – if the person might not pay you back, you want extra.|
|**LP**|Liquidity premium – if it’s hard to sell or trade the bond quickly, you want more crayons for the hassle.|

## 🎯 THE BIG FORMULA:

For Treasury bonds (safe):

`Treasury yield = r∗ + IP

`For corporate bonds (less safe):`

`Corporate yield = r∗ + IP + DRP + LP

**MRP (maturity risk)** is sometimes added too, but you're told it’s zero here, so we’ll ignore it for now.


### ✅ Let’s build a real-life example together:

Say the **10-year Treasury** is paying **6.10%**, and inflation over the next 10 years is expected to be **3.00%**.

### 🤔 Question:

> What is the **real risk-free rate (r*)**?

### 💡 Think of it like this:

If you know inflation = 3%, and total yield = 6.1%, the remaining 3.1% is your **real rate** — the “pure” thank-you-for-loaning-me-your-crayon rate.

So:

`$r∗=6.10%−3.00%=3.10%$`

### ✅ Now, say a **10-year Corporate bond** pays **9.25%**.

> How risky is that company?

Let’s find out how much **extra** you’re getting on top of the safe stuff:

`DRP + LP = 9.25% − 3.10% − 3.00% = 3.15%
So companies like that are “paying extra” because there’s risk **you won’t get your crayons back** (default risk) and maybe they’re **hard to trade** (liquidity risk).

## 🔁 Repetition = Mastery

Let’s stop copying and **do one together** right now.

Here’s your challenge:

A 5-year Treasury bond pays **3.25%**.  
We know inflation is **3%**, and we know **r*** is **3.10%** from earlier.

**What does this tell you? Is something off? Did the inflation drop? Is the bond underpaying?**

## **The market for capital**

Firms require capital to invest in productive opportunities. The best firms with the most profitable opportunities can attract capital away from inefficient firms with less profitable opportunities. Investors supply firms with capital at a cost called the interest rate. The interest rate that investors require is determined by several factors, including the availability of production opportunities, the time preference for current consumption, risk, and inflation.

Suppose the Federal Reserve (the Fed) decides to tighten credit by contracting the money supply. Use the following graph by moving the black X to show what happens to the equilibrium level of borrowing and the new equilibrium interest rate.

Which tend to be more volatile, short- or long-term interest rates?

Long-term interest rates

Short-term interest rates
> **Short-term interest rates** are more volatile.

Why?

- They react faster to changes in monetary policy (like what the Fed just did).
    
- Long-term rates adjust more slowly and are anchored by long-term expectations like inflation.

If the inflation rate was 3.40% and the nominal interest rate was 5.60% over the last year, what was the real rate of interest over the last year? Disregard cross-product terms; that is, if averaging is required, use the arithmetic average. Round intermediate calculations to four decimal places.

1.87%

2.20%

2.53%

2.75%
You’re given:

- **Nominal rate (rₙ)** = 5.60%
    
- **Inflation rate (IP)** = 3.40%
    

Use the **approximate real interest rate formula**:

r∗=rn−IPr^* = rₙ - IPr∗=rn​−IP r∗=5.60%−3.40%=2.20%r^* = 5.60\% - 3.40\% = \boxed{2.20\%}r∗=5.60%−3.40%=2.20%​

> ✅ **Answer: 2.20%**


## **Determinants of market interest rates**

Some characteristics of the determinants of nominal interest rates are listed as follows. Identify the components (determinants) and the symbols associated with each characteristic:

| Characteristic                                           | Component              | Symbol |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| Risk of interest rate changes on long-term bonds         | Maturity Risk Premium  | MRP    |
| Sum of inflation premium and r*                          | Nominal Risk-Free Rate | r_RF   |
| Increase in general price levels over time               | Inflation Premium      | IP     |
| Lacks marketability, hard to sell quickly                | Liquidity Premium      | LP     |
| Varies with productive opportunities and time preference | Real Risk-Free Rate    | r*     |
| Tied to bond rating, affects chance of non-payment       | Default Risk Premium   | DRP    |
