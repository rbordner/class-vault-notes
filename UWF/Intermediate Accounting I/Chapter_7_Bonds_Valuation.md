# 📘 Chapter 7: Bonds and Their Valuation

This Obsidian markdown file is based on your textbook (Intermediate Accounting PDF you uploaded). It is structured to help you **learn, retain, and answer questions** about bonds effectively.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Summary

### 7.1 Who Issues Bonds?
- **U.S. Treasury Bonds**: Default-free; risk-free in terms of credit, but sensitive to interest rate changes.
- **Corporate Bonds**: Higher return potential, includes default risk based on issuer's credit rating.
- **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by state/local governments; often **tax-exempt**.
- **Foreign Bonds**: Subject to both **credit** and **currency exchange** risks.

---

### 7.2 Key Characteristics of Bonds
- **Par Value**: Usually $1,000; repaid at maturity.
- **Coupon Interest Rate**: % of par paid annually or semiannually.
- **Maturity Date**: When par is paid back.
- **Call Provision**: Allows issuer to retire bond early.
- **Sinking Fund**: Provision to repay part of bond issue each year.
- **Convertibility**: Some bonds can be converted to stock.
- **Floating-Rate Bonds**: Interest adjusts with market rates.

### 7.3 Bond Valuation (📐 Formula-Based)
> **Bond Price = PV of Coupons + PV of Par**

**Present Value Equation**:
\[
P = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}
\]
Where:
- \( P \) = price of bond
- \( C \) = coupon payment
- \( F \) = face/par value
- \( r \) = required rate of return
- \( n \) = number of periods

**Zero-Coupon Bonds**:
- Sold at a discount, no periodic interest, value = PV of par.

---

### 7.4 Types of Bond Yields
- **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**: Return if held to maturity.
- **Yield to Call (YTC)**: Return if bond is called early.
- **Current Yield** = \( \frac{Annual\ Coupon}{Current\ Price} \)
- Use **BA II Plus** or **TI-84** to solve for YTM/YTC iteratively.

📌 *YTC is more relevant if bond is callable and interest rates drop.*

---

### 7.5 How Bond Prices Change Over Time
- As bonds approach maturity:
  - **Discount bonds** rise toward par.
  - **Premium bonds** fall toward par.
- Prices move **inversely** to interest rate changes.

---

### 7.6 Semiannual Bonds
- Most U.S. bonds pay interest **semiannually**.
  - Adjust formula:
    - \( r/2 \), \( n*2 \), and \( C/2 \)
  - Use **Bond worksheet on BA II Plus** or finance app.

---

### 7.7 Risks of Bond Investing
- **Price Risk (Interest Rate Risk)**: Market value drops when rates rise.
- **Reinvestment Risk**: Risk of reinvesting coupons at lower rates.

---

### 7.8 Default Risk and Ratings
- Use **S&P, Moody’s, Fitch** ratings:
  - Investment-grade: AAA to BBB-
  - Junk/Speculative: BB+ and below
- Bankruptcy outcomes:
  - **Chapter 7**: Liquidation
  - **Chapter 11**: Reorganization

---

### 7.9 Bond Markets and Trading
- Most bonds trade **OTC (Over-the-Counter)**.
- Prices often quoted as a % of par (e.g., 95 = $950).
- TRACE system for bond price reporting.

---

## 📎 Advanced Bond Types and Pricing

- **Putable Bonds**: Bondholders can sell back to issuer.
- **Income Bonds**: Pay interest only if issuer has earnings.
- **Warrants vs Convertibles**: Warrants allow stock purchase; convertibles swap bonds for stock.
- **Indexed Bonds (TIPS)**: Adjust for inflation.

**BA II Plus YTM**:
- 2nd → CLR TVM
- N = periods (years × 2 if semiannual)
- PV = negative bond price
- PMT = (coupon × par / frequency)
- FV = par (usually 1000)
- CPT → I/Y = yield
