<summary>7.3 Bond Valuation Formulas</summary>

```
Bond Price = PV of Coupons + PV of Par

P = Σ [C / (1 + r)^t] + [F / (1 + r)^n]
```
Where:
- P = price of bond
- C = coupon payment
- F = par value
- r = required return
- n = number of periods

</details>

<details>
<summary>7.4 Yield Types</summary>

- **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**: Return if held to maturity.
- **Yield to Call (YTC)**: Return if bond is called early.
- **Current Yield** = Annual Coupon / Current Price

🧮 Use your calculator to solve for YTM/YTC iteratively.

- **Premium bonds** fall toward par.
- Prices move **inversely** with interest rates.

- Adjust formula:
  - r ÷ 2
  - n × 2
  - C ÷ 2

## 🧮 Calculator Walkthrough (BA II Plus)

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| N     | # of periods (yrs × 2) |
| I/Y   | Yield rate (compute this!) |
| PV    | Negative bond price |
| PMT   | Coupon payment |
| FV    | Par value (usually 1000) |

Then CPT → I/Y
