---

## Overview

This chapter introduces the foundational principles, environment, and theoretical structure behind financial accounting in the United States. It explains **why** accounting standards exist, **how** they are developed, and **who** the key players are in the standard-setting process. It also introduces the **conceptual framework** for financial reporting, which provides the basis for resolving accounting and reporting questions.

## Objectives of Financial Reporting

The primary objective of financial reporting is to provide **useful information** to users who are making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.

$$
\text{Decision Usefulness} = \text{Relevance} + \text{Faithful Representation}
$$

### Key Users:
- Investors
- Creditors
- Lenders
- Other users (e.g., regulators)

## The Need for Accounting Standards

Without standards, financial reporting would lack:
- **Consistency**
- **Comparability**
- **Credibility**

Accounting standards:
- Promote **uniformity** across companies
- Ensure **transparency** in financial statements
- Help stakeholders make **informed economic decisions**

---

## Organizations Involved in Standard Setting

### 1. **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**
- Created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
- Has authority to set accounting standards for public companies
- Delegated this responsibility to the private sector

### 2. **Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)**
- Primary standard-setting body in the U.S.
- Independent, private sector body
- Publishes **Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)**

### 3. **American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)**
- Historical standard setter prior to FASB
- Still influences practice through audit guidance

---

## International Accounting Standards

### 1. **International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)**
- Develops **International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)**
- Goal: Global convergence of accounting standards

### 2. **Comparison: GAAP vs. IFRS**

| Feature            | GAAP             | IFRS                    |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Basis              | Rules-based      | Principles-based         |
| Inventory (LIFO)   | Allowed          | Not allowed              |
| Development Costs  | Expensed         | Can be capitalized       |

## FASB's Standard-Setting Process

1. Identify financial reporting issue  
2. Research and analyze issue  
3. Public hearing or invitation to comment  
4. Exposure draft  
5. Redeliberation  
6. Issue final **ASU** (Accounting Standards Update)

---

## Conceptual Framework

> The framework is not a standard itself, but provides the underlying foundation for creating accounting rules.

### Fundamental Qualitative Characteristics
- **Relevance**
  - Predictive value
  - Confirmatory value
  - Materiality
- **Faithful Representation**
  - Completeness
  - Neutrality
  - Free from error

$$
\text{Usefulness} \Rightarrow \text{Relevance} + \text{Faithful Representation}
$$

### Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics
- Comparability  
- Verifiability  
- Timeliness  
- Understandability

## Elements of Financial Statements

Defined by FASB as the basic elements directly related to measuring performance and financial position:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Assets} \\
\text{Liabilities} \\
\text{Equity} \\
\text{Investments by owners} \\
\text{Distributions to owners} \\
\text{Revenues} \\
\text{Expenses} \\
\text{Gains and Losses} \\
\text{Comprehensive Income}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Recognition and Measurement Concepts

### Four Basic Assumptions
1. **Economic Entity Assumption**
2. **Going Concern Assumption**
3. **Periodicity Assumption**
4. **Monetary Unit Assumption**

### Four Basic Principles
1. **Revenue Recognition**
2. **Expense Recognition (Matching)**
3. **Measurement Principle**
4. **Full Disclosure**

$$
\text{Measurement} = \text{Historical Cost, Fair Value, Net Realizable Value, Present Value}
$$

## Ethical Considerations in Accounting

- CPAs and accountants must uphold public trust  
- Common dilemmas:
  - Pressure to manipulate earnings  
  - Misstating estimates  
  - Concealing liabilities

### Codes of Ethics
- AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  
- State Board of Accountancy  
- Corporate codes of ethics

---

## Summary

- Financial reporting is driven by the need for **useful, comparable, and faithful information**
- The FASB is the primary U.S. standard setter
- The conceptual framework guides consistent application of principles
- Ethics and judgment are fundamental in applying GAAP

> **Tip for Mastery:** Ask yourself at each step, “Does this increase decision-usefulness for the end user?”
