# Chapter 5: Revenue Recognition

---

## Overview

Revenue is the **top line** of the income statement and one of the most critical figures in financial reporting.  
Under the joint standard **ASC 606 (U.S. GAAP)** and **IFRS 15**, revenue is recognized using a **five-step process** designed to reflect the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive.

---

## ✴️ The Five-Step Revenue Recognition Model

1. **Identify the contract with a customer**
2. **Identify the performance obligations**
3. **Determine the transaction price**
4. **Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations**
5. **Recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied**

---

## Step 1: Identify the Contract

A **contract** is an agreement that creates enforceable rights and obligations.

### Criteria:
- Approval by both parties
- Each party’s rights can be identified
- Payment terms are defined
- The contract has commercial substance
- Probable that consideration will be collected

If the contract fails these criteria, **revenue is not recognized** until they are met or consideration is received and nonrefundable.

---

## Step 2: Identify the Performance Obligations

A **performance obligation** is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service.

### Key Concept: **Distinct**
A good/service is distinct if:
- It provides a **benefit** on its own or with other resources the customer has
- It is **separately identifiable** in the context of the contract

### Examples of multiple obligations:
- Software license + installation + support
- Phone + service contract
- Training + equipment

---

## Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price

The **transaction price** is the amount the entity expects to receive in exchange for the promised goods or services.

### Components:
- **Fixed consideration**
- **Variable consideration** (bonuses, discounts, rebates, etc.)
- **Significant financing components**
- **Noncash consideration**
- **Consideration payable to a customer**

### Estimating Variable Consideration:
1. **Expected Value** method
2. **Most Likely Amount** method

Include only if **probable** that significant reversal will not occur (constrained).

---

## Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price

If there are **multiple performance obligations**, the total price must be allocated based on **standalone selling prices**.

### Formula:
$$
\text{Allocated Price} = \text{Total Transaction Price} \times \frac{\text{Standalone Selling Price}}{\sum \text{All SSPs}}
$$

### Example:

| Obligation          | SSP   | Allocation % | Allocated Revenue |
|---------------------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Software License    | $600  | 60%          | $600              |
| Installation Service| $200  | 20%          | $200              |
| Maintenance         | $200  | 20%          | $200              |
| **Total**           | $1000 | 100%         | $1000             |

---

## Step 5: Recognize Revenue When (or As) Performance Obligation is Satisfied

Revenue is recognized:
- **Over time**, if:
  - The customer consumes the benefit as it is provided
  - The asset has no alternative use and the company has enforceable right to payment
- **At a point in time**, when control transfers

### Indicators of control transfer:
- Legal title passed
- Physical possession
- Risks and rewards transferred
- Customer has accepted the asset

---

## 📄 Contract Modifications

A modification is a change in scope and/or price.

### Accounting Depends On:
1. **Separate Contract** (new goods/services, distinct, price reflects standalone value)
2. **Modification of Existing Contract**
   - Prospective (like a new contract)
   - Cumulative catch-up (adjust revenue in current period)

---

## 📦 Common Revenue Scenarios

### 1. **Licenses**
- **Right to use** (point in time)
- **Right to access** (over time)

### 2. **Warranties**
- **Assurance-type**: No separate performance obligation
- **Service-type**: Treated as a separate performance obligation

### 3. **Principal vs. Agent**
- **Principal**: Reports **gross** revenue
- **Agent**: Reports **net** revenue (only commission)

### 4. **Bill-and-Hold**
Revenue recognized only if:
- Customer requested the arrangement
- Goods are separately identified and ready for transfer
- Cannot use goods for other purposes

### 5. **Consignment**
Revenue not recognized until goods are sold by consignee.

## 🔄 Example: Journal Entries

**Contract**: $1,200 total for software, install, and support. Standalone selling prices:
- Software: $600
- Install: $300
- Support: $300

Allocated revenue:
- Software: $600
- Install: $300
- Support: $300

### Entry at delivery:
```
Accounts Receivable .......... 1,200
   Revenue – Software ................ 600
   Deferred Revenue – Install ........ 300
   Deferred Revenue – Support ........ 300
```

### After install completed:
```
Deferred Revenue – Install ......... 300
   Revenue – Install ...................... 300
```

### Over time (support):
```
Deferred Revenue – Support ......... 100
   Revenue – Support ..................... 100
```

## 🚫 Disclosures

Companies must disclose:
- Disaggregated revenue (by product line, region, etc.)
- Contract balances (receivables, contract assets/liabilities)
- Significant judgments
- Changes in contract assets/liabilities

---

## Summary

- Revenue recognition is governed by a 5-step model under ASC 606/IFRS 15
- Contracts must be evaluated for multiple obligations, variable pricing, and timing
- Judgments and estimates (e.g., variable consideration, stand-alone selling prices) are key
- Proper journalization and disclosure are essential

> **Tip for Mastery:** Practice identifying performance obligations, allocating price, and timing recognition across different industries (tech, retail, services).
