## 🏢 Overview

Within a firm, **Accounting Information Systems (AIS)** play a critical role in managing internal business processes.

### 🧾 Example:
An order entered into the system is:
1. Checked against credit and order history (finance module)
2. Verified for inventory (warehouse module)
3. Scheduled for delivery (logistics module)
4. Routed for invoicing (finance team)
5. Viewed/updated by all departments in real-time

This integration ensures a seamless workflow and faster resolution of issues (e.g., backorders, returns).
